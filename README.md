# Opal Fusion

Status: Pilot on `develop`. OpalFusion is not yet a final complete CashFusion support claim; the remaining proof gates are tracked in [CashFusion Native Swift Support Statement](docs/cashfusion-native-support-statement.md).

Opal Fusion is the CashFusion protocol and runtime package for the Opal Bitcoin Cash stack. It isolates coordinator connectivity, covert transport, round-state handling, commitments, blind-signature flow, transaction-signature submission, and blame handling behind a small Swift package boundary.

## Source Of Truth

- [CashFusion Implementation Spec](docs/cashfusion-implementation-spec.md): normative Electron Cash `4.4.3` protocol behavior, round lifecycle, timing, host seams, and package boundaries.
- [CashFusion Official Protocol Matrix](docs/cashfusion-official-protocol-matrix.md): row-level implementation status and test evidence against the pinned Electron Cash baseline.
- [CashFusion Native Swift Support Statement](docs/cashfusion-native-support-statement.md): current public support claim, intentional exclusions, and remaining proof gates.
- [Integration Guide](docs/integration-guide.md): how app and OpalBase layers should wire OpalFusion.
- [Validation Guide](docs/validation.md): fast local loops, focused protocol/runtime filters, live-smoke caveats, and transcript replay direction.
- [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md): compact maintainer map of public API, runtime, transport, wire, execution, host, and diagnostics layers.

## Stack Position

- Above `OpalCrypto`, which owns reusable Bitcoin Cash cryptographic primitives.
- Below `OpalBase`, which owns app-facing wallet, policy, orchestration, persistence, and product-facing integration.
- Separate from `SwiftFulcrum`, which owns Fulcrum transport responsibilities.
- Separate from product layers such as Opal Wallet.

## Boundaries

- Own CashFusion protocol/runtime behavior, coordinator-facing flow, round-state modeling, host integration seams, and interop-specific transport details.
- Do not own wallet UI, product-shell behavior, end-user fusion policy, transaction broadcast, or wallet persistence.
- Do not own generic Bitcoin Cash app orchestration that belongs in `OpalBase`.
- Do not own reusable cryptography that belongs in `OpalCrypto`.
- Do not own Fulcrum transport responsibilities that belong in `SwiftFulcrum`.

## Requirements

- Swift tools version: `6.2`
- Platforms: `macOS 26`
- Current live transport support, including the Tor SOCKS5 covert path, is macOS-only in this package.

## Installation

For public review of the current pilot surface, use the public `develop` branch or a specific public revision:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/58opals/OpalFusion.git", branch: "develop")
]
```

Do not treat `develop` as a SemVer release. The current pilot is intentionally narrow and remains blocked on repeated coordinator-backed confidence plus reviewed pinned transcript replay before a complete support claim.

## 5-Minute Integration Shape

OpalFusion exposes a conservative public `OpalFusion.Client.Session` wrapper over the internal runtime. The app or OpalBase layer supplies coordinator configuration, join pools, participant reservation material, transaction finalization, and observers.

```swift
import OpalFusion

let covertChannel = OpalFusion.Transport.CovertChannelConfiguration(
    entryPath: "/fusion",
    maxPayloadBytes: 32_768,
    requestTimeoutMilliseconds: 15_000
)

let configuration = OpalFusion.Client.Configuration(
    coordinatorHost: "coordinator.example.invalid",
    coordinatorPort: 8787,
    coordinatorRequiresTLS: true,
    covertChannel: covertChannel
)

let joinPools = OpalFusion.ProtocolModel.JoinPools(
    tiers: [10_000],
    tags: []
)

let optionalGenesisHash: [UInt8]? = nil

let session = OpalFusion.Client.Session(
    configuration: configuration,
    genesisHash: optionalGenesisHash,
    joinPools: joinPools,
    hostParticipantReservationSource: hostParticipantReservationSource,
    hostTransactionAssembler: hostTransactionAssembler,
    eventObserver: eventObserver,
    stateObserver: stateObserver
)

await session.start()
let snapshot = await session.currentSnapshot
```

See [Integration Guide](docs/integration-guide.md) for host callback responsibilities, privacy boundaries, and supported participant material.

## Current Pilot Envelope

- The supported live path is intentionally limited to compressed-key standard P2PKH participant inputs.
- Each reserved input must include the compressed public key that matches its standard P2PKH locking script.
- The host-finalized transaction must preserve a standard Schnorr P2PKH unlocking script for each local input.
- Broader BCH script support remains deferred and currently surfaces through `.notImplemented` when the unsupported path is reached.
- Coordinator defaults, retry cadence, wallet policy, signing authority, persistence, and broadcast remain app-owned.

## Common Developer Paths

- Wiring OpalFusion into an app or OpalBase layer: [Integration Guide](docs/integration-guide.md)
- Choosing the right local verification loop: [Validation Guide](docs/validation.md)
- Understanding maintainers' package map: [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md)
- Checking normative CashFusion behavior: [CashFusion Implementation Spec](docs/cashfusion-implementation-spec.md)
- Checking row-level conformance and remaining gaps: [CashFusion Official Protocol Matrix](docs/cashfusion-official-protocol-matrix.md)
- Checking the current support claim: [CashFusion Native Swift Support Statement](docs/cashfusion-native-support-statement.md)
- Preparing env-gated live proofing: [Electron Cash Live Pilot Confidence](docs/cashfusion-live-pilot-confidence.md)
- Preparing reviewed transcript fixtures: [Electron Cash Transcript Capture](docs/cashfusion-transcript-capture.md)

## Validation

Default local validation:

```bash
swift build
swift test
./scripts/run-validation-loop.sh codec
```

The fast local suite is the normal development loop. Live Electron Cash coordinator proofing is opt-in, environment-gated, registration-guarded, and should be treated as a slow confidence gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-electron-cash-interop-smoke.sh 3
```

See [Validation Guide](docs/validation.md) for focused filters, validation-loop modes, and slow proof gates.
