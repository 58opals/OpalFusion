# Opal Fusion

Status: the CashFusion engine is a pilot on `develop`; Mosaic is a draft specification with a deterministic in-process semantic core, canonical primitive codec, strict NIP-01 event validation, an authenticated NIP-44 boundary, replay and relay-publication guards, wallet-host contracts, and an internal bounded RFC 9474 authorization path, but no discovery, complete named wire messages, live transport, independently reviewed cryptographic deployment, or live runtime claim. The remaining CashFusion proof gates are tracked in [CashFusion Native Swift Support Statement](docs/cashfusion-native-support-statement.md).

Opal Fusion is the collaborative-transaction protocol package for the Opal Bitcoin Cash stack. It is the umbrella for the coordinator-based CashFusion compatibility engine and the peer-conducted Mosaic protocol, while OpalBase and Opal Wallet retain wallet policy, funds, signing authority, persistence, broadcast, and user experience.

## Source Of Truth

- [Opal Fusion Specification](docs/opal-fusion-specification.md): normative product hierarchy, shared facade, engine selection, fallback, and host boundaries.
- [Mosaic Protocol Specification](docs/mosaic-protocol-specification.md): draft peer-conducted protocol, roles, phases, manifest, transcript, transport contract, and release gates.
- [Mosaic Security Model](docs/mosaic-security-model.md): Mosaic threats, trust assumptions, safe claims, privacy limits, and review gates.
- [CashFusion Implementation Spec](docs/cashfusion-implementation-spec.md): normative Electron Cash `4.4.3` CashFusion behavior, round lifecycle, timing, and host seams.
- [CashFusion Official Protocol Matrix](docs/cashfusion-official-protocol-matrix.md): row-level implementation status and test evidence against the pinned Electron Cash baseline.
- [CashFusion Native Swift Support Statement](docs/cashfusion-native-support-statement.md): current public support claim, intentional exclusions, and remaining proof gates.
- [Integration Guide](docs/integration-guide.md): how app and OpalBase layers should wire OpalFusion.
- [Validation Guide](docs/validation.md): fast local loops, focused protocol/runtime filters, live-smoke caveats, and transcript replay direction.
- [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md): compact maintainer map of public API, runtime, transport, wire, execution, host, and diagnostics layers.

## Stack Position

- Above `OpalCrypto`, which owns reusable Bitcoin Cash cryptographic primitives.
- Below `OpalBase`, which owns app-facing wallet, policy, orchestration, persistence, and product-facing integration.
- Separate from `SwiftFulcrum`, which owns Fulcrum transport responsibilities.
- Separate from product layers such as Opal Wallet.

## Boundaries

- Own CashFusion and Mosaic protocol execution, engine-specific transport behavior, shared lifecycle contracts, privacy-safe diagnostics, and host integration seams.
- Keep the CashFusion fixed coordinator implementation outside this package; the eventual Mosaic engine may let a wallet process act as the ephemeral conductor for one attempt.
- Do not own wallet UI, product-shell behavior, end-user fusion policy, transaction broadcast, or wallet persistence.
- Do not own generic Bitcoin Cash app orchestration that belongs in `OpalBase`.
- Do not own reusable cryptography that belongs in `OpalCrypto`.
- Do not own Fulcrum transport responsibilities that belong in `SwiftFulcrum`.

## Requirements

- Swift tools version: `6.2`
- Platforms: `macOS 26`
- Xcode's Metal Toolchain component, required by the current OpalCrypto build plugin.
- Current live CashFusion transport support, including the Tor SOCKS5 covert path, is macOS-only in this package. Mosaic has no live transport implementation.

## Installation

For public review of the current pilot surface, use the public `develop` branch or a specific public revision:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/58opals/OpalFusion.git", branch: "develop")
]
```

Do not treat `develop` as a SemVer release. The current pilot is intentionally narrow and remains blocked on repeated coordinator-backed confidence plus reviewed pinned transcript replay before a complete support claim.

## 5-Minute CashFusion Pilot Integration

OpalFusion exposes a conservative public `OpalFusion.Client.Session` wrapper over the internal runtime. The app or OpalBase layer supplies coordinator configuration, join pools, participant reservation material, transaction finalization, and observers.

```swift
import OpalFusion

let covertChannel = OpalFusion.Transport.CovertChannelConfiguration(
    entryPath: "/fusion",
    maxPayloadBytes: 32_768,
    requestTimeoutMilliseconds: 15_000
)

let configuration = OpalFusion.Client.Configuration(
    coordinatorHost: "coordinator.example.invalid",
    coordinatorPort: 8787,
    coordinatorRequiresTLS: true,
    covertChannel: covertChannel
)

let joinPools = OpalFusion.ProtocolModel.JoinPools(
    tiers: [10_000],
    tags: []
)

let optionalGenesisHash: [UInt8]? = nil

let session = OpalFusion.Client.Session(
    configuration: configuration,
    genesisHash: optionalGenesisHash,
    joinPools: joinPools,
    hostParticipantReservationSource: hostParticipantReservationSource,
    hostTransactionAssembler: hostTransactionAssembler,
    eventObserver: eventObserver,
    stateObserver: stateObserver
)

await session.start()
let snapshot = await session.currentSnapshot
```

See [Integration Guide](docs/integration-guide.md) for host callback responsibilities, privacy boundaries, and supported participant material.

## Protocol-Neutral API Scaffold

The package now includes the protocol-neutral facade plus an internal peer-local Mosaic semantic core, deterministic multi-peer simulator, canonical primitive codec, strict NIP-01 event codec, NIP-44 encrypted-event boundary, authenticated replay guards, relay-publication quorum tracker, bounded RFC 9474 authorization execution, and narrow wallet-host contracts. Complete named payloads, transport adapters, and live effects remain unresolved or unimplemented, and the cryptographic path has not completed independent review, so these surfaces do not make Mosaic runnable over a network. `OpalFusion.Client.Session` remains the live CashFusion entry point; `OpalFusion.Session` intentionally has no public initializer yet.

```swift
let cashFusion = OpalFusion.CashFusion.Configuration(
    coordinator: configuration,
    genesisHash: optionalGenesisHash,
    joinPools: joinPools
)

let mosaic = OpalFusion.Mosaic.Configuration()

let automatic = try OpalFusion.Session.AutomaticConfiguration(
    candidates: [.mosaic(mosaic), .cashFusion(cashFusion)],
    fallbackPolicy: .beforeReservationOnly
)

let plannedMode = OpalFusion.Session.Mode.automatic(automatic)
```

Candidate order is supplied by OpalBase. Cross-engine fallback is permitted only before any wallet reservation; a failed active round becomes a new session attempt rather than an in-place protocol switch.

## Current CashFusion Pilot Envelope

- The supported live path is intentionally limited to compressed-key standard P2PKH participant inputs.
- Each reserved input must include the compressed public key that matches its standard P2PKH locking script.
- The host-finalized transaction must preserve a standard Schnorr P2PKH unlocking script for each local input.
- Broader BCH script support remains deferred and currently surfaces through `.notImplemented` when the unsupported path is reached.
- Coordinator defaults, retry cadence, wallet policy, signing authority, persistence, and broadcast remain app-owned.

## Common Developer Paths

- Wiring OpalFusion into an app or OpalBase layer: [Integration Guide](docs/integration-guide.md)
- Choosing the right local verification loop: [Validation Guide](docs/validation.md)
- Understanding maintainers' package map: [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md)
- Checking the shared facade and engine-selection contract: [Opal Fusion Specification](docs/opal-fusion-specification.md)
- Reviewing the Mosaic design and its limits: [Mosaic Protocol Specification](docs/mosaic-protocol-specification.md) and [Mosaic Security Model](docs/mosaic-security-model.md)
- Checking normative CashFusion behavior: [CashFusion Implementation Spec](docs/cashfusion-implementation-spec.md)
- Checking row-level conformance and remaining gaps: [CashFusion Official Protocol Matrix](docs/cashfusion-official-protocol-matrix.md)
- Checking the current support claim: [CashFusion Native Swift Support Statement](docs/cashfusion-native-support-statement.md)
- Preparing env-gated live proofing: [Electron Cash Live Pilot Confidence](docs/cashfusion-live-pilot-confidence.md)
- Preparing reviewed transcript fixtures: [Electron Cash Transcript Capture](docs/cashfusion-transcript-capture.md)

## Validation

Default local validation:

```bash
swift build
swift test
./scripts/run-validation-loop.sh codec
```

The fast local suite is the normal development loop. Live Electron Cash coordinator proofing is opt-in, environment-gated, registration-guarded, and should be treated as a slow confidence gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-electron-cash-interop-smoke.sh 3
```

See [Validation Guide](docs/validation.md) for focused filters, validation-loop modes, and slow proof gates.
